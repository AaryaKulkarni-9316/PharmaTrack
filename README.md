# PharmaTrack
1.Drug Inventory and Supply  Chain Tracking System.  
2.Efficiently manages pharma  stock by tracking quantities,  expiry, and batches, using RFID,  IoT, and blockchain for  traceability, anti-counterfeiting,  and regulatory compliance. 
# Objectives
1.Blockchain-Enabled Tracking: Ensures tamper-proof, transparent logging of drug batches with secure hash linking.
2.RFID & IoT Integration: Simulates batch-level identification and real-time monitoring of storage conditions like temperature.
3.Inventory Management: Tracks drug quantities, expiry dates, and batch details for efficient stock control.
4.Anti-Counterfeiting & Traceability: Verifies drug authenticity and provides complete traceability across the supply chain.
5.Role-Based Design Ready: Structured to support manufacturers, distributors, and retailers with scalable access.
6.Multilingual Support Ready: Designed for global accessibility, enabling a user-friendly experience in multiple languages.
# Programming languages used : C++
# Data Structures and Algorithms used: Linked List, Hashing, Structures, Stack, Queue
#  Libraries used : iostream, string, ctime, sstream, vector, openssl/sha.h
# Future project perspective :
1.DBMS Integration (MySQL/PostgreSQL):
  Store all drug, user, and transaction data persistently in a centralized or distributed database for secure long-term access, analytics, and backups.
2.Online Pharmaceutical Selling Platform:
  Extend the system to support e-commerce features where verified retailers or consumers can purchase authentic medicines online, directly from manufacturers or     licensed suppliers.
3.Real-Time Supply Chain Monitoring (via IoT):
  Use IoT sensors to live-monitor temperature, humidity, and movement of drug shipments â€” ensuring compliance and safety during transportation.
4.Mobile & Web-Based Dashboard:
  Develop multilingual mobile/web apps for easy access by healthcare providers, warehouse managers, and pharmacists with real-time inventory, alerts, and tracking.
5.AI Integration for Predictive Analytics:
  Use machine learning to predict:
  i)Drug demand
  ii)Expiry alerts
  iii)Stockouts or surplus trends
  iv)Automate reordering based on usage patterns.
6.Government & Health Authority Integration:
  Connect with national drug control systems (like CDSCO in India) for automatic compliance, recall alerts, and nationwide drug traceability.
7.Role-Based Access & Authentication:
  Add secure login portals for manufacturers, distributors, retailers, and regulators with different permissions and blockchain-verified logs.
8.Data Visualization and Reports:
  Integrate charting tools to visualize inventory status, sales trends, delivery times, and temperature history for data-driven decisions.
